   those bytecodes; id is used to pair jump bytecodes with their
   destinations: in the initial scan, when we encounter a jump
   bytecode we fill two block_boundaries -- one has positive id and
   represents the destination of the jump, one has negative id (but
   the same absolute value) and represents the jump bytecode

   backward jumps in the same way.

   When single blocks are optimized, the sorted block_boundaries are
   examined one at a time.  As we process blocks, we fill an array of
   jump structures with offsets in the optimized bytecode.  We fill a
   single field at a time -- the id's sign in the block_boundary says
   which field is to be filled, the absolute value gives which jump
   structure is to be filled.  In the end, block_boundaries whose id's

   - a slot is the same in both stacks, so it has this type in the output too
